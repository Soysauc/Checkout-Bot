### BotDevelopment

The purpose of this project was to continue practicing my Node JS skills for backend development. I also wanted to test out the Library Puppeteer for experience building things without a front end UI. I also had come across the idea because a family member enjoys purchasing rare and limited collectors items and every time I wait in a virtual line the prodect is immediately sold out, due to other 'sneaker' or 'checkout' bots.
So I thought it would be a nice personal side project to build one.
