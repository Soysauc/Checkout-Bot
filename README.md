# Bot Development

The purpose of this project was to continue practicing my Node JS skills for backend development. I also wanted to test out the Library Puppeteer for experience building things without a front end UI. I also had come across the idea because a family member enjoys purchasing rare and limited collectors items and every time I wait in a virtual line the prodect is immediately sold out, due to other 'sneaker' or 'checkout' bots.
So I thought it would be a nice personal side project to build one.

Again not for commercial use, anyone seeing this may want to use it but if used incorrectly, or even correctly, it may get your IP Address banned from whatever site you're testing this from.
For example, I initially tested this software on Walmart.com but they kept throwing 'captchas' or other mouse tricks and even when I jumped and fulfilled the tests correctly it jumped off. I later tested the software on Creation.Hasbro.com but what was interesting was that the element doesn't pop up on screen (according to the same ID) until the mouse tracks over it.
